# piecemeal

Piecemeal is meant to be a simple, but meaningful, online showcase for your projects, services, and apps. 

Many-a-times, you might want to show off a project you're working on, including the components in your project, the styling, and give a background on it.

Not everyone has the time to sign up for your service, or to complete all the steps to get to a certain part of the app, or simply the time to walk through your project to see each and every piece of it.

That's where Piecemeal comes in -- it's meant to serve as a quick but demonstrative showcase of your project, app, or service, where you can add the context imagery of the pieces that comprise your project.

It's almost like [about.me](about.me), but more directly oriented on showcasing your apps and WIP's, while also highlighting the skills and talent you used to build your pieces.
