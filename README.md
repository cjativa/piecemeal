# piecemeal

Piecemeal is meant to be a simple, but meaningful, online showcase for your projects, services, and apps. 

Many-a-times, you might want to show off a project you're working on, including the components in it, the creativity involved, and the effort you put in.

Not everyone might have the time to sign up for your service to go through, or to complete all the steps needed to get to a certain part of the app, or simply the time to walk through your project to see each and every part of it.

That's where Piecemeal comes in -- it's meant to serve as a quick but demonstrative showcase of your project, app, or service, where you can add the context, the fine details, and the imagery of the pieces that comprise your project.

It's almost like [about.me](about.me), but more directly oriented on showcasing your apps and WIP's, while also highlighting the skills and talent you used to build your pieces.
